The notaion

$$\left\{x_1v_1+x_2v_2+\cdots+x_kv_k\ |\ x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_k\in\mathbb{R}\right\}$$

reads as: "the set of all things of the form $x_1v_1+x_2v_2+\cdots+x_kv_k$ such that $x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_k$ ae in $\mathbb{R}$." The vertical lne is "such that"; everything to the left of it is "the set of all tings of this form", and everything to th right is the condition that those things mus satisfy to be in the set. Specifying a set in this way is called ***set builder notation***.
