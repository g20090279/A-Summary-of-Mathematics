# Defintion

A subset of a set is any collection of points of the set.

# Example: Suset of $\mathbb{R}^n$

The unit circle

$$C=\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2|x^2+y^2=1\right\}$$

is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Note that it reads $C$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x^2+y^2=1$.
