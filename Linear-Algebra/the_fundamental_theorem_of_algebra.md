[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra] [d'Alembert's Theorem] [d'Alembert-Gauss Theorem]

# The Theorem

Why complex numbers or the complex analysis are important? This may result from the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

> **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.** Given any positive integer $n\geq1$ and any choice of complex numbers $a_0,a_1,\cdots,a_n$, such that $a_n\neq0$, the polynomial equation
$$a_nz^n+\cdots+a_1z+a_0=0$$
has at least one solution $z\in\mathbb{C}$.

Literally the theorem states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Equivalently, the theorem tells that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, showing why the complex analysis becomes important and interesting.

Note that this is **not true for real number**, i.e. it doesn't hold that a real solution exists to the above equation if the coefficients are real numbers. For an example, $x^2+1=0$ has no real solution.Similarly, no analogous result holds neither for integer case nor rational case.Therefore, the complex numbers are special for this case.
