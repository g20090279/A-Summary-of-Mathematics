# History

Schur decomposition is named after Issai Schur, a Russian mathematician who worked in Germany for most of his life.

**When did Schur published his work about Schur decomposition?**

# Basic Idea

The Schur decomposition states that an $n\times n$ square matrix in $\mathbb{C}$ can be expressed as

$$A=QUQ^{-1},$$

where $Q$ is a unitary matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular matrix.

# Notes

- Every square matrix has a Schur decomposition.
- In general, Schur decomposition is not unique.
