| $f(x)$ | $\frac{d}{dx}f$ | Proof | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $|x|$ | $\frac{x}{|x|}$ | proof-absolute | for $x\neq0$ since not differentiable at 0 |

# Proof

## proof-absolute

$|x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. Therefore, the derivative of $|x|$ works for all $x\neq0$. The derivative of $|x|$ can be written as a piecewise function as

$$\frac{d}{dx}|x|=\begin{cases}
x & x>0\\
-x & x<0.
\end{cases}$$

This is a signum function. And $|x|/x$ and $x/|x|$ are equivalent to the signum function.
